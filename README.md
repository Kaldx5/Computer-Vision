 # Computer Vision Learning Journey 📸

Welcome to my Computer Vision learning journey! This repository contains my notes, code implementations, and project milestones as I dive deeper into the field of computer vision.

## Introduction 📚
I’ve recently started studying Computer Vision, and I'm documenting my progress here. This journey reflects my ability to quickly adapt to new environments, starting from Course 3 out of 6 in a specialization without prior knowledge in the earlier sections. This repository will show how I grow in the field by learning, applying, and experimenting with Computer Vision concepts and technologies.

## Main Goals 🎯
The main objectives of this course are:
1. **Understanding Computer Vision**: Learn what Computer Vision is and how it’s applied in real-world scenarios.
2. **Applying CV Algorithms**: Work with Computer Vision algorithms using Python and OpenCV to process images and extract useful information.
3. **Creating Custom Classifiers**: Develop my own custom classifiers to detect and recognize objects.
4. **Building a Web App**: Build a web application that classifies images based on the classifiers and algorithms implemented.

## Resources I Am Using 📘
1. **[Introduction to Computer Vision and Image Processing](https://www.coursera.org/learn/computer-vision-image-processing/home/welcome)**  
   IBM Course 3 of 6 in the IBM AI Engineering Specialization.
2. **YouTube Tutorials & Research Papers**  
   Many online video courses and academic research papers have been incredibly helpful in reinforcing concepts and exploring practical applications.
3. **University Course: Image Processing**  
   A formal course I took on Image Processing that laid the foundation for my understanding of the core principles behind Computer Vision.

## My Learning Approach 📈
One of my strengths is the ability to dive into new environments or topics that are unfamiliar to me and rapidly grow in them. As part of this journey, I started with the third course in the IBM AI Engineering Specialization without having done the earlier courses. I navigate the content by moving forward or revisiting foundational topics as needed, which has been key to my growth.

## Progress So Far ✏️
- **Handwritten Notes**: I’ve summarized the core concepts I’ve learned so far in handwritten notes. You can check these in the [Notes and Summaries](./images/) folder.
- **Code Implementations**: I’ve started experimenting with Python and OpenCV, laying the groundwork for more complex projects.
  
## What's Next? 🔜
As I dive deeper into Computer Vision, I plan to explore more advanced topics, including:
- **Custom Object Detection**: Building detectors that can recognize objects in real time.
- **Real-time Processing**: Implementing real-time video processing techniques.
- **Deep Learning Integration**: Incorporating deep learning techniques to improve classification accuracy and automation.

Stay tuned for updates and new projects!
